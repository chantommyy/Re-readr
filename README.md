<h3>#About the project</h3>

My team (4 people in total) built the project "Re:readr" in 2 weeks. This platform allows you to exchange books you no longer need for ones you'd like to read. To use the platform, simply create an account on Re:readr, enter the ISBN code for the book you'd like to add and exchange it for another book. 

*How it works:*

- Register an account
- Enter the ISBN of your book to upload it on the platform
- Search for available books
- Send a request for the book you like
- Exchange your book
- Leave a review

<h3>#Installation</h3>

To run our app locally, you will need to have already installed [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable) and [Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v5.0/getting_started.html). Check them with:
```
$ yarn -v 
$ rails --version
```

If no version number is returned, please install [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable) and/or [Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v5.0/getting_started.html) before continuing.


**Dependencies**

You'll also need to install all dependencies of the project with:
```
$ bundle install && yarn install
```

The `bundle` command installs all Ruby Gems specified in our Gemfile. The ```yarn install``` command retrieves all dependencies from the project’s package.json file.

Run the following command to create a database, load the schema, and initialize it with our seed data. 

```
$ rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
```


**Launch**🚀

Launch the app by running:
```
$ rails s
```
```
$ yarn build --watch
```
